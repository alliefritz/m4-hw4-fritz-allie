         <h3>Evolution of Their Sound</h3>
         <p>While the band started out as a hardcore, metalcore-focused band, over time, their sound has evolved and expanded as they have experimented with different sounds and styles, while keeping the integrity of what the band stands for. The band saw some pushback from older fans who were upset the sound has strayed from its darker metalcore roots, and the band has addressed that in the song "Heavy Metal" off their 2019 album, <i>Amo</i>.</p>

         <h2>Why This Band</h2>
         <p>I chose Bring Me The Horizon for this assignment because, while I have a lot of favorite musical artists, this is an incredibly special band to me. I have loved this band for 14 years, over half of my lifetime. The care, thought, effort, and love this entire band puts into their music is evident. I was recently able to see this band live for the first time and they hold a special place in my heart.</p>
